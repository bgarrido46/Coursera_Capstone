    "Of all the fast food restaurants, my friends and family frequent Chick-fil-A the most by far.  Every time we go, there are always several customers there and we joke that Chick-fil-A is a gold mine.  Recently, I got to meet someone going through the training program to become a restaurant operator and I'd like to apply what I've learned to potentially help them find the best locations to open a new restaurant, specifically in the Austin area of Texas."
